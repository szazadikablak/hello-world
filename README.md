# hello-world

Heyho!

They said,write some word about myself. K so heres my short story: i just leveled up to 30(too much rpg,heh?),and i found it out,my work does not entertain me. You know that feeling,when you wake up and askin' yourself: why do i still work here or there? 

So at the moment im trying to catch my childhood dream, wannabe a dev. We will see how far this journey brings me.
